# A Weighted Hierarchical Cross-entropy Loss for Classification of Astrophysical Transients

This repository is for the workshop proceeding [NeurIPS Workshop paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02266) by Villar et al., and the paper [The Impact of Host Galaxy Properties on Supernova Classification with Hierarchical Labels](arxiv.org) by Villar et al. It is associated with the manuscript number Z. 

The `supernova-example-24.ipynb` notebook contains the most relevant tutorial, and shows classification of a fake set of supernovae using the weighted hierarchical cross-entropy loss. 

The `supernova_example.ipynb` notebook reproduces results for the SN sample from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Supernova Survey.

The `variable_star_example.ipynb` notebook reproduces results for the variable star sample (also from the Zwicky Transient Facility).

Note that python >=3.10 is required.
