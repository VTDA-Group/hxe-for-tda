# A Weighted Hierarchical Cross-entropy Loss for Classification of Astrophysical Transients

This repository contains code behind [our NeurIPS Workshop paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02266). The Weighted Hierarchical Cross-entropy Loss is implemented in PyTorch.

To reproduce the paper results and figures, unzip all data files and run the Jupyter notebooks. Note that python >=3.10 is required.



*This code is by no means well-optimized.* Any comments welcome and appreciated!
